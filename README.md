# Python-week-8-final-
Build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends.

üåç COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using Python. It includes visualizations such as line charts, bar plots, choropleth map, and more to explore trends in cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts across selected countries and world.

---

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real-world COVID-19 data
- Compare case and death trends between countries
- Visualize global vaccine rollout and case density
- Extract insights and patterns using Python visualizations

---

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (for choropleth maps)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrsBubblegum/Python-week-8-final-.git

## Key Insights
-Countries like the USA and India experienced the highest case counts.
-Some countries had significantly higher death rates, suggesting healthcare strain or underreporting.
-Vaccine rollouts were not consistent globally; Italy had a faster rollout compared to South Africa and Brazil.
-Missing data and irregular reporting posed challenges during analysis.

## Reflections
Working with real-world data highlighted the importance of preprocessing and data integrity. The project improved my data handling, visualization, and analytical thinking skills using Python tools.
